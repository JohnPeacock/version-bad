version 0.56_02
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  Note that the CPAN release cannot be installed
with the interim 5.9.0, 5.9.1, and 5.9.2 releases (since it duplicates code
in the core).  If you are testing bleadperl, you will need to check out the
latest release of 5.9.x to get the changes included in 0.50.

Major changes in 0.56_02
==================================
Fully implemented UNIVERSAL::VERSION in the pure Perl module.  Revert
change to implementation modules so that the $VERSION testing in the main
module loads the correct underlying module during testing.

Major changes in 0.56 (was 0.55)
==================================
Nothing at all.  This is the second in a series of "not very well tested
Build.PL" changes.  If you want the pure Perl implementation installed you
must follow the instructions below; the Build.PL file will not do this by
itself.


Major changes in 0.54
==================================
This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by calling the build script as

    $ perl Build.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

NOTE: there is also a significant change in the behavior of the XS module.
Versions prior to 0.54 mistakenly cloned an existing object, if new()
was called as an object method.  In other words:

    $v2 = $v1->new(); # formerly would assign the value of $v1 to $v2

This behavior was wrong, and I apologize profusely.


Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.
