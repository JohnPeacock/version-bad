version 0.28
====================

WARNING: This module is considered experimental, since it uses features 
from the Perl development release v5.9.0 which have not been finalized yet.  
DO NOT USE THIS MODULE IN PRODUCTION CODE!

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.0 (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module's code will not be used, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.

Now includes a subclass, version::AlphaBeta, which demonstrates using
alphanumeric version strings, instead of strict numeric versions.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.
