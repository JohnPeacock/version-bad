version 0.49
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  Note that the CPAN release cannot be installed
with the interim 5.9.0, 5.9.1, and 5.9.2 releases (since it duplicates code
in the core).  If you are testing bleadperl, you will need to check out the
latest release of 5.9.x to get the changes included in 0.48.


Major changes in this release:
==================================
Changes in 0.48 accidently broke modules depending on qv() returning an 
object derived from 'version'.  Tests were simplified since the
implementation class 'version::vxs' is no longer independent of the main
class.


Major changes in 0.48
==================================
Significant archectectural change (object hash has to contain reference to
array not the array itself); see

    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14439>

for details.  Initial changes to support pure Perl variant (not
included yet), see

    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14417>

for more details.  All POD moved to seperate file.  Tests
abstracted out for reuse by different classes.


Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.
