version 0.76
==================================

Full version object support, with patch for bug in Perl 5.10.0 core
version support.

YOU SHOULD INSTALL THIS RELEASE WHEN USING VERSION OBJECTS IN PERL 5.10.0.
There was a bug caused by objects serialized by YAML that will cause Perl
5.10.0 to segfault.  As long as some module calls 'use version', then the
replacement code will take effect and Perl will not crash.

Major Changes in 0.76 - 2008-07-08
===================================
Fix segfault with core version stringification of serialized version 
objects without an 'original' entry.  See

	http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=56606

for more details.  I cannot make this 100% automatic; some module has to
call 'use version;' for the fixed code to take effect.


Major Changes in 0.7501 - 2008-06-14
=====================================

Installs correctly on Perl v5.10.0 (only the version.pm and
version.pod) with both Makefile.PL and Build.PL.  Unify version.pm
with core copy for future Perl releases.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   $ perl Build.PL
   $ ./Build
   $ ./Build test
   # ./Build install

This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by calling the build script as

    $ perl Build.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

OR

To install with ExtUtils::MakeMaker:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   # make install

and correspondingly

   $ perl Makefile.PL --perl_only

will install the Perl only version.
  

DEPENDENCIES

The same C compiler used to build Perl (or not).  Module::Build 0.2611
or better.

Module::Build installs fine under 5.005_03 or better, though the optional
dependency Archive::Tar doesn't.  If you install Module::Build without any
of the optional dependencies, you can safely install version.pm.
