version 0.63
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  Note that the CPAN release cannot be installed
with the interim 5.9.0, 5.9.1, and 5.9.2 releases (since it duplicates code
in the core).  If you are testing 5.9.x, you must check out bleadperl in
order to get the current changes (the CPAN release has no effect in
bleadperl).

Major changes in 0.63 - 2006-05-27
=====================================
Fix RT#19517 - need to special case the string 'undef' as being equivalent
to an undef version (0.000), so that EU::MM doesn't freak out.  Prevent
warnings when initializing with undef or no initializer at all.

Major changes in 0.61 - 2006-05-23
=====================================
Include better ppperl.h as well as avoid re-exporting qv() if version.pm
use'd more than once.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   $ perl Build.PL
   $ ./Build
   $ ./Build test
   # ./Build install

This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by calling the build script as

    $ perl Build.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

DEPENDENCIES

The same C compiler used to build Perl (or not).  Module::Build 0.2611
or better.

Module::Build installs fine under 5.005_03 or better, though the optional
dependency Archive::Tar doesn't.  If you install Module::Build without any
of the optional dependencies, you can safely install version.pm.
