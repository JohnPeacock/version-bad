version 0.58
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  Note that the CPAN release cannot be installed
with the interim 5.9.0, 5.9.1, and 5.9.2 releases (since it duplicates code
in the core).  If you are testing bleadperl, you will need to check out the
latest release of 5.9.x to get the changes included in 0.58.

Major changes in 0.58
==================================
Fix mainline code to work on Perl 5.6.x again (a few 5.8.x'isms had crept 
in to the C code and tests).  Compatibility with Perl 5.005_x is currently
broken for the XS module; the pure Perl module works fine, though.  The XS
code should be fixed in 0.59, sorry.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   $ perl Build.PL
   $ ./Build
   $ ./Build test
   # ./Build install

This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by calling the build script as

    $ perl Build.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

DEPENDENCIES

The same C compiler used to build Perl (or not).  Module::Build 0.2611
or better.

Module::Build installs fine under 5.005_03 or better, though the optional
dependency Archive::Tar doesn't.  If you install Module::Build without any
of the optional dependencies, you can safely install version.pm.
