version 0.75
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.10.0 release. 
In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version of Perl >= v5.9.0,
the CPAN release of this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  All prior releases of version.pm are considered
obsolete and should not be used (and have been deleted from CPAN), due to
API changes leading up to Perl v5.10.0.

Major Changes in 0.75 - ??????????
===================================

Optionally use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader for Perl 5.6.0 or better.

Major Changes in 0.74 - 2007-10-24
===================================

Final release before Perl v5.10.0.  API now frozen for all eternity.  Fixes
problem with Data::Dumper being too clever by half.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   $ perl Build.PL
   $ ./Build
   $ ./Build test
   # ./Build install

This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by calling the build script as

    $ perl Build.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

OR

To install with ExtUtils::MakeMaker:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   # make install

and correspondingly

   $ perl Makefile.PL --perl_only

will install the Perl only version.
  

DEPENDENCIES

The same C compiler used to build Perl (or not).  Module::Build 0.2611
or better.

Module::Build installs fine under 5.005_03 or better, though the optional
dependency Archive::Tar doesn't.  If you install Module::Build without any
of the optional dependencies, you can safely install version.pm.
