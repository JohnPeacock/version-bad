version 0.7501
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.10.0 release. 
In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version of Perl >= v5.9.0,
the CPAN release of this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  

All releases of version.pm prior to 0.74 are considered obsolete and should
not be used (and have been deleted from CPAN), due to API changes leading up
to Perl v5.10.0.  If you 'use version' in your code, you are strongly urged to
set a minimum, e.g. 'use version 0.74' (to remain compatible with Perl
v5.10.0).  

NOTE: unless otherwise noted in 40 foot tall block letters, any subsequent CPAN
release is 100% code equivalent with the core Perl v5.10.0 version.pm objects,
and exists only to improve documentation (and/or backwards compatibility for
Perl versions before v5.10.0).  If you 'use version 0.75', you will cause 
a meanlingless upgrade for Perl v5.10.0 (it only installs the
documentation).


Major Changes in 0.7501 - 2008-06-14
=====================================

Installs correctly on Perl v5.10.0 (only the version.pm and
version.pod) with both Makefile.PL and Build.PL.  Unify version.pm
with core copy for future Perl releases.

Major Changes in 0.75 - 2008-06-07
===================================

Optionally use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader for Perl 5.6.0 or better.
Resolves: 

	http://rt.cpan.org//Ticket/Display.html?id=34590

Improved documentation on stringification and round-trip behavior.
Resolves:

	https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28206

Much more strident documentation that you should not use a release of
version.pm earlier than 0.74 (due to incompatible API changes) and you
should always require 0.74 (to prevent meaningless upgrades).

Major Changes in 0.74 - 2007-10-24
===================================

Final release before Perl v5.10.0.  API now frozen for all eternity.  Fixes
problem with Data::Dumper being too clever by half.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   $ perl Build.PL
   $ ./Build
   $ ./Build test
   # ./Build install

This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by calling the build script as

    $ perl Build.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

OR

To install with ExtUtils::MakeMaker:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   # make install

and correspondingly

   $ perl Makefile.PL --perl_only

will install the Perl only version.
  

DEPENDENCIES

The same C compiler used to build Perl (or not).  Module::Build 0.2611
or better.

Module::Build installs fine under 5.005_03 or better, though the optional
dependency Archive::Tar doesn't.  If you install Module::Build without any
of the optional dependencies, you can safely install version.pm.
