version 0.53
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  Note that the CPAN release cannot be installed
with the interim 5.9.0, 5.9.1, and 5.9.2 releases (since it duplicates code
in the core).  If you are testing bleadperl, you will need to check out the
latest release of 5.9.x to get the changes included in 0.50.

Major changes in 0.53
==================================
The version parsing code always ignored trailing text that couldn't be
parsed.  Now carp about it and show what was ignored.  Suggested by David
Wheeler.


Major changes in 0.52
==================================
Check for malformed initializer ("1_2") based on discussion about
some bleadperl bugs with vector printing:

	sprintf of version objects
	<https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=37897>

Minor changes in 0.51
==================================
Continue rewriting the POD as the situation changes with regards to support
for version objects in various scaffolding programs (CPAN indexer does so
support version objects).

Major changes in 0.50
==================================
Completely rewritten POD to hopefully make it clear what is the recommended
Best Practices (to go along with Damien's book).  I also hid the forthcoming
pure Perl module better (you cannot accidently use it, in other words,
since it only exists on my hard-drive for now).  I also dealt with the
following bugs:

	fails tests on AIX 5.1
	<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=15254>

	Missing vpp.pm
	<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16249>


Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.
