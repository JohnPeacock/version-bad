version 0.45
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.0 (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.

Numification was stripping trailing zeros unnecessarily (noticed by Andreas
Koenig).

GCC 4.0 and 4.1 have broken multiple -I include file behavior, see
L<http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20348> for details.  The 0.44
release only renames some files to prevent this bug from occurring.  No
other changes were made.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The 0.43 release was a major rewrite of the internal code and
also changes how different version objects are stringified in a way that is
inconsistent with prior releases.

In particular, if a version object is created as a "Quoted Version"
(multiple decimal places, using qv(), or as a v-string), it will always
stringify with at least 3 terms (2 decimal places), as well as with a leading
'v' character.  This may lead to inconsistencies with Perl < 5.8.1 if the
stringified version is eval()'d (so don't do that!).  This may more closely
approximate the version object behavior in Perl6 (where the leading 'v'
notation will mean version instead of v-string).  There is no guarantee
that this behavior will persist.

In addition, the use of two significant digits with an alpha release
(e.g. 1.23_01, common with some CPAN releases) is now fully supported and
will stringify in the same way as was input (with the possible addition of
trailing zeros, e.g. 1.23_010, to make up multiples of three digits).

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.
