version 0.58
==================================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.x (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.  Note that the CPAN release cannot be installed
with the interim 5.9.0, 5.9.1, and 5.9.2 releases (since it duplicates code
in the core).  If you are testing bleadperl, you will need to check out the
latest release of 5.9.x to get the changes included in 0.58.

Major changes in 0.58
==================================
Fix mainline code to work on Perl 5.6.x again (a few 5.8.x'isms had crept 
in to the C code and tests).  Compatibility with Perl 5.005_x is currently
broken, both for pure Perl and XS modules.  This should be rectified in 
0.59, sorry.

Major changes in 0.57
==================================
Fully implemented UNIVERSAL::VERSION in the pure Perl module.  Revert
change to implementation modules so that the $VERSION testing in the main
module loads the correct underlying module during testing.  Subclass
Module::Build so lack of compiler is not fatal.

This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by calling the build script as

    $ perl Build.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.
